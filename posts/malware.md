Malware is designed to disrupt the normal operations of a device. Malware is a general term that can refer to viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and other types of harmful software. Malware is intentionally malicious; any software that unintentionally causes harm is not considered malware.

Rootkits are designed to modify an operating system to conceal unwanted installations from the user. A famous example is the 2005 Sony rootkit scandal when Sony sold 22 million CDs infected with a rootkit that would discreetly install software intended to disrupt digital pirates. Unfortunately, this rootkit unlocked the door for attackers to target infected computers with malware.

No one can be entirely impenetrable to malware attacks; new attacks are continuously being developed. However, there are ways to minimize exposure to malware attacks. For example, executing routine antivirus scans on a computer or network is crucial to detecting threats before spreading.
