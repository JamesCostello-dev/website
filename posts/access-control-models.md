Access control is an essential element of data security that dictates who can access and use company information and resources. Through authentication and authorization, access control policies ensure users are whom they say they are and have appropriate access to company data. Access control can also limit physical access to campuses, buildings, rooms, and data centers. 

Institutions typically choose the most tactful method based on their security and compliance needs. The three main access control models are:  

* Discretionary access control (DAC): This method provides access control based on the user's identity and authorization level within the organization. These rules state what a user can or cannot access. 

* Role-based access control (RBAC): This method enables access based on a user's role in the organization and system requirements to fulfill that role.

* Mandatory access control (MAC): is a method of restricting access to resources based on the acuity of the data that the resource contains and the user's authorization to access information with that level of sensitivity.

Access control preserves confidential information such as customer data, private information, and intellectual property from falling into the wrong hands. Without solid access control policies, organizations risk data breaches from internal and external sources.
