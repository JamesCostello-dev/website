Web application security is a vital element of any web-based business. Web application security deals precisely with the security of websites, web applications, and application program interfaces (APIs).

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject client-side scripts into a webpage to access data directly, mimic the user, or deceive the user into exposing critical information.

SQL injection (SQi) is a strategy by which an attacker manipulates vulnerabilities in how a database performs search queries. Attackers use SQi to acquire access to unauthorized data, modify or create new user permissions, or control or destroy sensitive data.

Denial-of-server (DoS) & distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) are methods of attacks to overload a targeted server or infrastructure. When a server cannot process incoming requests, the server begins to act sluggishly and ultimately deny service to incoming requests from legitimate users.

Essential steps in protecting web apps from exploitation include using:

* up-to-date encryption
* requiring proper authentication
* continuously patching discovered vulnerabilities
* sound software development practices.

The reality is that savvy attackers may be able to find vulnerabilities even in a moderately robust security environment. Therefore, holistic security techniques are advised.
