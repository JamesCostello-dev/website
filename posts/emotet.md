The Emotet Trojan is considered the world's most dangerous malware. Emotet was designed as a banking malware that attempted to creep onto a computer and steal sensitive data. Emotet is a piece of malicious software called a Trojan that primarily spreads through emails. The infection may come through a malicious script or link. Emotet emails are often designed to look legitimate. However, Emotet may sway users to click the malicious files by using persuasive language about invoices or payment details. 

Emotet often uses Visual Basic macro embedded Microsoft Office documents to retrieve the virus payload from the attacker's servers. In addition, Emotet uses many tricks to try and stop detection and analysis. For example, Emotet knows if it is running inside a virtual machine and will lay stagnant if it detects a virtual environment. Cybersecurity researchers use virtual machines to study malware in a safe environment.

The primary distribution technique for Emotet is through email. Emotet raids a user's contacts list and sends itself to coworkers and clients. Since these emails are coming from hijacked accounts, the emails look legitimate, and the recipients are likely to click malicious links and download infected files. Emotet does not discriminate against its targets; individuals, companies, and governments are all at risk. Due to the non-discriminatory nature of Emotet, companies risk reputation loss, data theft, and compliance violations since Emotet generally targets banking organizations. 

Users can protect themselves from Emotet first by learning how Emotet takes advantage of targets since Emotet preys on users to spread. Next, keep systems up to date, as Emotet will use secondary attacks on its target, leveraging operating system vulnerabilities. Third, never download suspicious software or click unfamiliar links. Finally, use a robust cybersecurity program with multi-layered protection.
