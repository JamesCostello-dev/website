DNS enables users to connect to websites using domain names rather than IP addresses.

Domain Name System is the phonebook of the Internet. We access data online through domain names like example.com, and web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP). DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses so that browsers can load resources. Devices connected to the Internet have a unique IP address that other machines use to find the device.

DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (www.example.com) into an IP address (192.168.1.1). Each device is assigned an IP address to find the appropriate device, like a residential address to find a home. When a user requests a webpage, translation must occur between what the user types into the browser (example.com) and the address required to locate the example.com webpage.
