DNS or Domain Name System is the phonebook of the Internet. We access data online through domain names like example.com, and web browsers interact through Internet Protocol or IP. DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses allowing browsers to load data. Devices connected to the Internet possess a unique IP address that other machines use to find the device.

DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (192.168.1.1). An IP address is assigned to all devices on the Internet; that address is required to find the destination device, like an address used to find a home. When a user requests a webpage, translation must occur between what they type into their browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address required to locate the example.com webpage.
