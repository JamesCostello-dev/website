DNS enables users to connect to websites using domain names rather than IP addresses.

Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. We access data online through domain names like example.com, and web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP). DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses allowing browsers to load data. Devices connected to the Internet possess a unique IP address that other machines use to find the device.

DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (www.example.com) into an IP address (192.168.1.1). An IP address is assigned to each device on the Internet; that address is required to find the appropriate device, like a residential address used to find a home. When a user requests a webpage, translation must occur between what they type into the browser (example.com) and the address required to locate the example.com webpage.
