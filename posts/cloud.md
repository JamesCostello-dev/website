The cloud is made up of servers in data centers worldwide. Shifting to the cloud can save businesses money and add convenience for users.

"The cloud" refers to servers accessed over the Internet and the software and databases on those servers. By utilizing cloud computing, users and businesses do not have to handle physical servers or run software applications on their machines.

The cloud allows users to access the duplicate files and applications because the computing and storage take place on servers in a data center instead of locally on the user device. For businesses, switching to cloud computing removes costs and overhead: for instance, they no longer need to update and maintain their servers, as the cloud provider will do that. This dramatically impacts small businesses that may not have been able to afford their internal infrastructure but can outsource their infrastructure via the cloud. The cloud can also make it more manageable for companies to operate internationally because employees and customers can access files and applications from any location.

Cloud computing is attainable because of a technology called virtualization. Virtualization enables the creation of a simulated, virtual computer that acts as if it were a physical computer, aka a virtual machine. When appropriately executed, virtual machines on the same host device are sandboxed from one another, so they do not interact. The files and applications from one virtual machine are not observable to the other virtual machines even though they are on the same physical device.
